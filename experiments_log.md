# General Notes
- omitting `bee` cluster as the jobs fail there

# Simple Grid Search
- it seems that the best learning rate is `0.000075`
    - other comparable are `0.00001` and `0.000005`
    - with respect to high amount of experiments we will focus only on the learning rate `0.0000075`

# Simple evaluation
