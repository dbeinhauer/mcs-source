# Characterizing computations in a model of biological vision using deep-neural-network approaches

- way from eye -> neurons in retina (horizontal cells etc.) - there are ON/OFF cells -> LGN -> V1
- many of the inputs from LGN are also from the V1
    - serves as reference for signal modulation (relative signal based on the current need)

# Primary Visual Cortex (V1)
- divided into layers (I - VI)
- our main concern are layers II/III and IV
- majority from LGN -> layer IV (specificaly IVC - also reccurent input from VI)
- from IV -> II/III
- both layers also contain horizontal conections between nearby neurons
    - II/III also contains intra-layer conections of neurons with similar receptive field properties
- also projections to other cortical areas V2, V3, V4 and V5
- neurons nearby in V1 have typicaly similar properties (retinotopy - the close one on retina are also close in the layer)

# Computational Neuroscience
- combines math and computer science to understand nervous system
- more data -> possible usage of deep learning approach

## Stimulus
- might be just an image (+ some additional information)

## Response
- spikes (typical approach) - fire rate (number of spikes in a given interval)
