# About
This directory is a placeholder for best model parameters storage. During training the currently 
best model parameters (based on normalized CC) should be stored there in a `.pth` file with 
the appropriate naming corresponding the model hyperparameters selection. Please refer to 
`execute_model.py` for hyperparameters and their corresponding definition in `nn_model/` directory
where the implementation of the model is stored and naming of the best models is defined.
