# About
This directory is a space where all the evaluation results and best
models should be stored. Namely:

- `best_models/` - directory where the best models during the training should be stored (best models in terms of CC_NORM in validation set).
- `full_evaluation_results/` - directory where the model predictions should be stored.
- `neuron_model_responses/` - directory where mapping input-output neuron values should be stored (not working now).
