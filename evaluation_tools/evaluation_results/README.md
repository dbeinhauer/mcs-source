# About
This directory serves as a placeholder where all the evaluation results and best
models should be stored. Namely:

- `best_models/` - Directory where the best performing model parameters during the training should be stored in order to run the evaluation using these model parameters.
- `full_evaluation_results/` - Directory where the model predictions should be stored.
- `neuron_model_responses/` - Directory where mapping input-output neuron values should be stored (not working now).
- `full_dataset_analysis/` - Directory where results of the analysis of the full dataset on different time binning size should be stored.
- `subset_dataset_analysis/` - Directory where results of the analysis of the subset dataset on different model subset variants should be stored.
- `evaluation_analysis/` - Directory where results of the analyses of the model predictions should be stored.
- `wandb_results/` - Directory where the results from Weights and Biases tool should be stored.
